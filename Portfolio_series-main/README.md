# SUSHMITA — THE SERIES

A cinematic, streaming-inspired portfolio for **Sushmita Dasari**: Full-Stack Developer and B.Tech AI & ML student.
Every section is an episode, every project is an Original, and the whole site plays like a series.

> A personal portfolio with a fictional streaming-platform look. It is not affiliated with Netflix or any other streaming service and uses none of their logos.

## Run it locally

Requires **Node.js 18+**.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The static site is written to `dist/` and can be deployed as-is to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages or any static host.

## Updating the content

**All content lives in one file: [`src/data/portfolio.ts`](src/data/portfolio.ts).** It was generated from the resume, and every component reads from it.

| To change… | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Name, intro, email, LinkedIn, GitHub | `profile` |
| A project, or a new one | `projects` (add an object; it appears in Originals, the overlay, the resume sheet and the counts) |
| Achievements / certifications | `achievements`, `certifications` |
| Skills and their "where it's used" notes | `skillCategories`, `skillEvidence` |
| Seasons and episodes (My Journey) | `seasons` |
| Top 10 row | `topPicks` |
| ▶ Play Intro highlight reel | `introSlides` |
| Profile order (Recruiter / Developer / Creative) | `viewerProfiles` |
| Opening studio card text | `profile.originalLabel` |

**Resume:** replace `public/assets/Sushmita_Dasari_Resume.pdf`.

**Photo:** replace `pic1.jpeg` (high-res photo) and `pic.png` (background-removed cutout with the same framing), then run:

```bash
npm run images
```

This rebuilds the responsive WebP portraits and the social share image in `public/assets/`.

```

**Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion 11, Lenis.

## Accessibility and performance

- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected: smooth scroll, the custom cursor, tilt, particles, grain and the pinned horizontal scroll turn off, and the opening jumps straight to its final frame.
- Hover effects only run on devices with a precise pointer. Touch devices get tap interactions and native swipe rails.
- The custom cursor appears only with a mouse or trackpad.
- Overlays close with Esc, and the highlight reel supports Space and the ← → keys.
- Portraits are responsive WebP files (25–90 KB). Overlays are code-split, and particles pause when they're off screen.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- **Opening:** Enter or Esc skips it.
- **Play Intro:** Space pauses, ← and → change slides, Esc closes.
- **Project and resume overlays:** Esc closes.
